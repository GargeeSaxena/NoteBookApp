# üö® FIX BOTH ISSUES NOW - FOLLOW EXACTLY

**READ CAREFULLY: You must do BOTH sections below. Don't skip any steps!**

---

## üîß SECTION 1: Fix Authentication Page (Do This First!)

### Step 1.1: In Android Studio

Click these buttons IN ORDER:

1. **File** ‚Üí **Sync Project with Gradle Files** (wait for it to finish)
2. **Build** ‚Üí **Clean Project** (wait for it to finish)
3. **Build** ‚Üí **Rebuild Project** (wait for it to finish - THIS IS CRITICAL)

**Wait for all three to complete before moving on!**

---

### Step 1.2: On Your Phone/Emulator

**YOU MUST DO THIS - The app won't work otherwise!**

1. Find the **Notebook** app icon
2. Long press it
3. Tap **App info** or **Info**
4. Tap **Storage** or **Storage & cache**
5. Tap **Clear storage** or **Clear data**
6. Tap **Clear all data** or **Delete**
7. Confirm "OK"

**OR just uninstall:**
1. Long press **Notebook** app
2. Tap **Uninstall**
3. Confirm

---

### Step 1.3: Run the App Again

1. In Android Studio, click the green **‚ñ∂ RUN** button
2. Wait for the app to install
3. The app will open
4. **YOU SHOULD NOW SEE THE LOGIN/SIGNUP SCREEN!** ‚úÖ

**If you DON'T see the login screen, you didn't clear the data properly. Go back to Step 1.2!**

---

## üóÑÔ∏è SECTION 2: Fix Storage Bucket (Do This Second!)

The storage bucket literally doesn't exist in your Supabase project. You MUST create it manually.

### Step 2.1: Open Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Log in if needed
3. Click on your project (the one with ID: mkxytkpewzmaucgwhahs)

---

### Step 2.2: Run the SQL Migration

1. In the left sidebar, click **SQL Editor**
2. Click **New query** button
3. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `migrations/create_storage_bucket.sql`
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click the **RUN** button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
6. You should see: **"Success. 1 row(s) returned"**

**If you get an error, the bucket might already exist - that's OK!**

---

### Step 2.3: Verify the Bucket Exists

1. In the left sidebar, click **Storage**
2. You should see a bucket named **note-attachments**
3. It should show as **Public**
4. Click on it to open it

**If you DON'T see the bucket:**
- The SQL didn't run correctly
- Try creating it manually:
  - Click **New bucket**
  - Name: `note-attachments`
  - Check "Public bucket"
  - Click **Create bucket**

---

### Step 2.4: Test File Attachments

1. Open your app
2. Create a note and save it
3. Click **Attach File**
4. Select any file
5. **IT SHOULD UPLOAD NOW!** ‚úÖ

**If you STILL get "Bucket not found":**
- The bucket name might be wrong
- Make sure it's exactly `note-attachments` (with the hyphen)
- Rebuild and reinstall the app
