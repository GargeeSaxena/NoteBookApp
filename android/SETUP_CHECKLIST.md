- [ ] JDK 17 installed
- [ ] Supabase account and project created
- [ ] Node.js backend is working (web app runs successfully)

## Supabase Backend Setup âœ“

### Database Schema

- [ ] Run `schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Run `migrations/2025-10-15_add_user_id_to_notes.sql`
- [ ] Run `migrations/2025-10-18_add_premium_and_attachments.sql`

**Quick SQL for storage policies:**
```sql

WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'note-attachments');

-- Allow public reads
CREATE POLICY "Allow public reads" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'note-attachments');

-- Allow authenticated deletes
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'note-attachments');
```
