- Graceful error handling for network issues

## üéØ Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
- **Model**: Data classes (User, Note, Attachment)
- **View**: Activities and XML layouts
- **ViewModel**: Business logic and state management

### Repository Pattern
- `AuthRepository`: Authentication operations
- `NotesRepository`: Notes and attachments CRUD

### Dependency Flow
```
Activity ‚Üí ViewModel ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Supabase SDK
```

## üîí Security

### Authentication
- JWT tokens managed by Supabase SDK
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure session storage

### Data Access
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on database
- Users can only access their own notes
- File storage respects database relationships

### API Keys
- Supabase anon key is safe to embed
- RLS policies protect data
- No service key in client

## üì± Compatibility

### Android Versions
- **Minimum**: Android 7.0 (API 24)
- **Target**: Android 15 (API 35)
- **Tested**: Android 8.0+ recommended

### Screen Sizes
- Phone: Full support
- Tablet: Supported (phone layout)
- Landscape: Supported

### Features Required
- Internet connection (required)
- Storage permission (for file uploads on Android <13)
- Camera permission (not required, but useful for photos)

## üöÄ Performance

### Optimization
- RecyclerView with DiffUtil for efficient list updates
- Coroutines for async operations
- View binding for efficient view access
- Minimal memory footprint

### Loading States
- Progress indicators during operations
- Pull-to-refresh for manual updates
- Empty states for better UX

## üìä Limitations

As per requirements:

1. **No Payments**: DodoPayments not implemented
   - Premium status is read-only from database
   - Must be set manually via SQL

2. **No Real-time Sync**: 
   - Manual refresh required
   - Could be added with Supabase Realtime

3. **No Offline Mode**:
   - Requires internet connection
   - Could be added with local database (Room)

4. **Google OAuth Incomplete**:
   - Opens browser but doesn't handle callback
   - Requires deep link setup for full functionality
   - Email/password works perfectly

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Rich text editing (bold, italic, lists)
- Image preview for image attachments
- File download functionality
- Share notes feature
- Search and filter notes
- Tags/categories for notes
- Dark mode (theme is ready, needs toggle)
- Biometric authentication

## üìö Code Examples

### Creating a Note
```kotlin
val note = Note(
    userId = userId,

viewModel.createNote(note)
```

### Uploading Attachment
```kotlin
val file = File(path)
viewModel.uploadAttachment(
    noteId = noteId,
    file = file,
    fileName = "document.pdf",
    mimeType = "application/pdf"
)
```

### Observing Data
```kotlin
viewModel.notes.observe(this) { notes ->
    adapter.submitList(notes)
}
```
