## Let's Fix Everything! (10 minutes)

---

## Part 1: Fix Authentication Flow ✅

I've updated the code to properly check Supabase sessions. Now you need to rebuild:

### Step 1: Sync & Rebuild in Android Studio

```
1. File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
   (Wait for sync to complete)

2. Build → Clean Project
   (Wait for clean)

3. Build → Rebuild Project
   (Wait for rebuild - this is important!)
```

### Step 2: Completely Remove Old App

**On your device/emulator:**

1. Long press the **Notebook** app icon
2. Tap **Uninstall** or drag to trash
3. Confirm uninstall

*This ensures all old cached data is completely gone!*

### Step 3: Run Fresh Install

1. In Android Studio, click the green **▶️ Run** button
2. Wait for the app to install
3. The app should open automatically

### Step 4: You Should See Authentication Screen! 🎉

Now you'll see:
- **Sign In** button
- **Sign Up** button  
- **Sign in with Google** button (optional - needs setup)
- Email and Password fields

✅ **Success! You got the auth page!**

## Part 2: Enable File Attachments ✅

The "Bucket not found" error means you need to create a storage bucket in Supabase.

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket in Supabase

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Bucket** button
5. Enter:
   - Name: `note-attachments`
   - ✅ Check "Public bucket"
6. Click **Create bucket**

### Step 2: Add Storage Policies

Click **SQL Editor** in Supabase dashboard, then run this SQL:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
INSERT INTO storage.policies (name, bucket_id, definition, check_expression)
VALUES (
  'Allow authenticated uploads',
  'note-attachments',
  'bucket_id = ''note-attachments'' AND auth.role() = ''authenticated''',
  'bucket_id = ''note-attachments'' AND auth.role() = ''authenticated'''
);

-- Allow everyone to read
INSERT INTO storage.policies (name, bucket_id, definition)
VALUES (
  'Allow public reads',
  'note-attachments',
  'bucket_id = ''note-attachments'''
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete
INSERT INTO storage.policies (name, bucket_id, definition, check_expression)
VALUES (
  'Allow authenticated deletes',
  'note-attachments',
  'bucket_id = ''note-attachments'' AND auth.role() = ''authenticated''',
  'bucket_id = ''note-attachments'' AND auth.role() = ''authenticated'''
);
```

Click **Run** - you should see "Success"

✅ **Done! Storage is ready!**
